# open-sourcing-semiconductor-manufacturing
The high costs of proprietary tools and a lack of open access to semiconductor R&amp;D facilities are a key barrier for academia and indigenous chip design startups in India. This project aims to explore different models for open sourcing certain elements of the semiconductor fabrication and design value chain.
